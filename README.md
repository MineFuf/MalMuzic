## Welcome to MalMuzic

#### Thanks for stopping by.

## What is MalMuzic?

It's simple program mabe for my fellow weebs.
When you want all your openings and endings from your anime list, currently only [MAL](https://myanimelist.net/), you can downloaded them, and then later just start again, just update your library without downloading anything again. Your songs will be downloaded to folders like "completed" and "onhold" etc.

## To do:
- Fix a lot of bug (but somewhat working anyway)
- Add filters such as only anime with more than 7 score on your list
- Add option to download only to download only ops or eds
- Enable downloading not from anime list but from just lists of mal ids
- Add blacklist for anime you don't wanna download from your list
- Be able to choose what lists to download, useful when you don't wanna download lists like dropped or ptw
- Saving and loading configs, when you don't wann a remember your configuration
- Theme selector
- Cancel download
